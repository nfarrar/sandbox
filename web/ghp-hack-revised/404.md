### Whoops, that page isn't here!

> A bright moon rising over the sea,
Shores apart, watching the same
Is someone dear to me.
I loath this endless night;
And could not sleep but think of thee.
In this full moon light,
Who cares for candlelight?
Stepping out I don my gown,
And feel dew on the ground.
I wish to offer you moonlight in a handful,
But, to my real shame, â€˜tis impossible.
Retirng to my bed, it seems,
I might find happier days in dreams.
-- Zhang Jiu Ling, Thinking Afar in Moonlight
